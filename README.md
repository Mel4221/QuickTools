# QuickTools
This is my first C# Libreary and this  has been created in the C# languague to try to help reduce the amout of code required to create simple tools

#today i added the entired libreary to  try to keep it save since the first time i create it i lost must of its data , so now we have a new biggining . 

# today i was making sure to finally complete the encrypting Class and decryption , so far i have came up with 2 models , one that 
uses a method of switching bytes and executing mathematical operations on each bytes to encrypt the data and it either returns plane text or 
it actually reuturns the plane text already decrypted  , and other hand i added the one that im the most proud of and is one that use the hash of a password to generate an intenger that is used to process a mattematical operations over each of the bytes then finally i will add it to switch places  
and encrypt the  file multiple times to make sure that it could be more secure
